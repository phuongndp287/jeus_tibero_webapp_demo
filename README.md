This project demonstrates a **web application** built and deployed using **JEUS 8.5** as the application server and **Tibero** as the database management system. It leverages modern Java web technologies to create a robust and scalable web application.
## Technologies Used
### **1. JEUS 8.5**
- Application server for hosting and running enterprise Java applications.
- Provides a reliable, secure, and efficient environment for deploying web applications.

### **2. Tibero**
- High-performance RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) used as the backend database.
- JDBC driver (`tbjdbc8`) is used for database connectivity.
- Ensures enterprise-grade performance and scalability.

### **3. Maven**
- Standard build tool for managing dependencies and the project lifecycle.
- Simplifies dependency management and package builds.

### **4. Java EE**
- The application uses the **Java EE** ecosystem for enterprise features such as Servlets, JSPs, and JSTL.
- Supports standard interfaces with robust integration strategies.

### **5. Dependencies**
The project dependencies are configured in for smooth integration: `pom.xml`
- **Tibero JDBC Driver (`tbjdbc8`)**: Allows database connectivity.
- **Java EE API**: Provides standard interfaces for core Java EE features.
- **JSTL (Java Server Pages Standard Tag Library)**: For creating dynamic content in JSPs.
- Other tools such as the Maven Compiler and WAR plugins are included for smooth development and packaging.

### **6. Front-End Integration**
- Bootstrap for responsive design.
- Optionally supports language localization and customization.

## Setup Instructions
### **1. Prerequisites**
Before deploying this application, ensure the following:
- **JEUS 8.5** is properly installed and configured.
- **Tibero RDBMS** is installed with a valid schema for the application.
- Maven is installed to build and package the application.

### **2. Database Configuration**
- Update the Tibero database configuration (URL, username, password, etc.) in the relevant places (e.g., `data source configuration` in JEUS or application-specific properties).
- Ensure the `tbjdbc8` dependency is included and loaded by the JEUS server.

### **3. Building the Application**
Run the following Maven commands:
``` sh
# To clean previous builds
mvn clean

# To package into a WAR file
mvn package
```
This generates a `.war` file in the `target` directory.
### **4. Deploying on JEUS**
- Upload the WAR file to JEUS's deployment directory or deploy it through the JEUS Management Console.
- Configure the application's data source within the JEUS server to use the Tibero JDBC driver.

## Project Structure
1. **Frontend**:
   - Uses JSP for server-side rendering.
   - CSS and JavaScript for UI and dynamic behavior.

2. **Backend**:
   - Java EE Servlets for handling requests and responses.
   - Tibero database as the core data store.

3. **Build Tool**:
   - Maven for dependency management and compiling the project.

## Key Configuration Files
1. : **pom.xml**
   - Specifies dependencies such as Tibero JDBC, Java EE API, and JSTL.
   - Configures the Maven WAR and compiler plugins.

2. **Web Deployment Descriptor** (, if used): `web.xml`
   - Configures servlets, JSPs, and other application components.

3. **JEUS Data Source Configuration**:
   - Configures the connection pool and binds application resources to the Tibero database.

## Running the Application
1. Build the application using Maven.
2. Deploy the WAR file on JEUS via the management console or CLI.
3. Access the application by navigating to its URL (e.g., `http://<server-ip>:<port>/<context-path>`).
4. Ensure the Tibero database is connected and accessible.

## Notes
- Ensure proper encoding settings (e.g., UTF-8) in both the database and the application.
- Add additional localization support or customized themes as needed.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate security features such as Single Sign-On (SSO) or OAuth.
- Add support for more databases (if required) and backend services.
- Implement advanced error logging and monitoring features.
